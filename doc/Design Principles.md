# BlueJay54 design principles

- add a second 4.7uF decoup cap to right hand
- keep trace from decoupling caps to ground plane as short as possible
- large decouping cap close to jack on right hand
- ideal spacing between PTH components: spread components on entire board as uniformly as possible, minimum distance between two components (body to body) of 4mm, minimum distance from lead to lead of 2.5mm

- 6 columns, 5 rows in total (of which one is thumb cluster): 5 top row + 3x6 middle + 4 thumb cluster per hand: total of 54 keys
	+ All 1U keys:
	+ 10 x R1 top (number) row
	+ 12 x R2 qwerty row
	+ 10 x R3 home row + 2 R3 homing keys
	+ 12 x R4 bottom row
	+ 8 x R2 thumb keys (get an extra set of 8 R1 keys as well)
	+ = Total 54 keycaps
