# BlueJay54 To Dos

- [ ] Finish updating edge cut for right hand and base
- [ ] Move things around a bit as per recommendations received
- [ ] Reduce number of mounting holes to 6, and do not use mounting posts between plate and main pcb (only use them between main pcb and base): will need small access holes in the plate for hex key to tighthen screws
- [ ] Update Gerber Files
