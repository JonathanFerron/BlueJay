 Split Ergo Keyboard

This is a project for a new split ergonomic QMK-powered keyboard. The goal is for it to be minimalist, meant for users who strictly touch-type, and made with easy to solder through-hole components. It is significantly inspired on the [Torn] https://github.com/rtitmuss/torn split keyboard, with modifications such as adding a partial "numrow" and moving the thumb cluster further out.
